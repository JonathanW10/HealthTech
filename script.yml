--Hi Raj!
-Hi Justin, how's your evening? 
--Not too bad. Just passing the time.
-If you could be anywhere right now, where would you go? 
--You know, I think I'd be out on the lake with my brother. We used to go fishing every weekend. 
-Oh I love fishing, that sounds so peaceful. Did you have a favorite spot? 
--Oh, absolutely. A quiet little lake just outside town. Best place to cast a line and argue over who caught the bigger fish! [chuckles] 
-Sounds like good times. What's the biggest fish you ever caught? 
--A bass huge one! Nearly pulled me right in. My brother laughed so hard he almost dropped his pole. 
-That must've been a sight! Do you miss those days?
--Oh, every day. But talking about it it's almost like I'm there again. 
-I'm glad. Good memories deserve to be shared.
--They sure do. Thanks for the chat it's nice to have someone to talk to. 
-Anytime, Mr. Thompson.
